# 🗑️ Obsolete Files

These files are no longer needed but kept for reference.

## Files in This Folder

- **APPLY_CLEAN_STUDENT_MIGRATION.sql** - Superseded by COMPLETE_STUDENT_MANAGEMENT.sql
- **APPLY_STUDENT_MIGRATIONS.sql** - No longer needed (migrations archived)
- **ADD_INSERT_POLICIES.sql** - Merged into COMPLETE_STUDENT_MANAGEMENT.sql
- **DISABLE_RLS_FOR_SEEDING.sql** - Not needed (using INSERT policies instead)
- **ENABLE_RLS_AFTER_SEEDING.sql** - Not needed (using INSERT policies instead)

## Why Obsolete?

All these files were either:
1. Merged into `COMPLETE_STUDENT_MANAGEMENT.sql`
2. Replaced by better approaches
3. No longer relevant to current workflow

## Can I Delete These?

Yes, after confirming everything works in production. Keep them for now as backup.
