  The file is in the program because:

If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ id: any; name: any; class_type: any; sessions_per_week: any; }[]' is missing the following properties from type '{ id: string; name: string; class_type: string | null; sessions_per_week: number | null; }': id, name, class_type, sessions_per_week
